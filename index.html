                Harem anime is a good way for bored people to escape from this cruel world and enjoy.<br>
                It teaches us valuable life lessons and also increase our knowledge in different aspects.<br>
                Like geography from "One Piece", Japanese Culture from "Naruto"<br>
                These anime are typically long, which keeps you occupied for a long time
                My personal favorite is "One piece" and "Redo H".
